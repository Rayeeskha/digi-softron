					<h1>What is website development?</h1>

					<p>Website development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves a range of tasks, including designing the website's layout and structure, coding the website using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and setting up and configuring servers to host the website. Website development can also include tasks such as creating and managing databases, integrating third-party tools and services, and optimizing the website for search engines and accessibility.

					<p><b>4. Create a wireframe:</b>
					Develop a basic outline of each page's layout, including the placement of images, text, and other design elements.</p>

					<p><b>5. Develop content: </b>Write and edit the content that will be featured on each page of the website.</p>

					<p><b>6. Design the website:</b>

					<h1>Website development cost</h1>
